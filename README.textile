h2. Incanter

_Incanter is a Clojure-based, R-like statistical computing and graphics environment for the JVM._

Motivation for a Lisp-based R-like statistical environment can be found in the paper "Back to the Future: Lisp as a Base for a Statistical Computing System":http://books.google.com/books?id=8Cf16JkKz30C&pg=PA21 by Ihaka and Lang. Motivation for a JVM-based Lisp can be found at the "Clojure website":http://clojure.org, and screencasts of several excellent Clojure talks by the language's creator, Rich Hickey, can be found at "clojure.blip.tv":http://clojure.blip.tv.


*Additional Clojure resources*

* For a great introduction to programming in Clojure, read "Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM.":http://ociweb.com/jnb/jnbMar2009.html by R. Mark Volkmann.
* For an even more extensive introduction, get the beta version of the book "Programming Clojure":http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure by Stuart Halloway.


*To build and use Incanter, run the following commands from the Incanter directory:* 

* Build incanter.jar: @ant@
* Run unit tests: @tests/runtests.clj@ 
* Generate API docs: @bin/generate_docs.clj@
* Start the Clojure shell (aka the REPL) from the Incanter directory: @bin/clj@
* From the Clojure shell, load the Incanter libraries: @(use '(incanter core stats datasets charts))@
* Generate some random data and plot a histogram: @(view (histogram (sample-normal 1000)))@
* See the next section for more examples

(Note: the @bin/clj@ and @*.clj@ scripts won't run on Windows systems as is. Although, the Clojure code contained in the @*.clj@ scripts can be run from the Clojure shell.)


*Incanter examples*

* The online documentation for most functions contain usage examples. The documentation can be accessed using Clojure's @doc@ function. For example, to view the documentation for the @linear-model@ function, use @(doc linear-model)@ from the Clojure shell. The API documentation is also available in @docs/api/index.html@ and online at "incanter.org/docs/api/.":http://incanter.org/docs/api Use @(find-doc "search term")@ to search the online documentation from the Clojure shell.
* See @examples/@ directory
* See @tests/test-cases.clj@
